In this project we provide a pytorch implementation of [iCaRL](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07725). Furthemore, experiments with different losses and classifiers are reported. 
Look at the full [report](https://github.com/mdn33/Incremental_Learning/blob/master/Incremental_Learning_in_Image_Classification_Report.pdf)
